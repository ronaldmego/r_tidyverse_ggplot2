## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#distribucion binomial
```{r}
success <- 0:20

plot(success,dbinom(success,size=20,prob=.3),
     type='h',
     main='Binomial Distribution (n=20, p=0.3)',
     ylab='Probability',
     xlab ='# Successes',
     lwd=10)
```
```{r}
n <- 2000
p <- 300/2000
q <- 1-p

sdp <- sqrt(p*q/n)
p-2.58*sdp
```
